- Kuhlmeier:
	- Principle cut two articles on pregnancy and parent's divorce.
	- Student's felt it violated free speech, sued and brought it to the Supreme Court.

- Nancy Reagan began a campaign on the **war on drugs** in the 1980s. With several commercial advertisements and PSAs.
	- "Just say no."
	- The sentiment was that much of the campaign was an overly simplistic way to approach the war on drugs but boiling it down to just telling people not to use them.
		- A lot of the vocabulary used against the use of drug could be considered mocking.
- The Reagan administration established several anti-drug measures such as regulated drug testing. 
	- This was also when "mandatory minimums" were established, increasing the incarceration rate substantially in the US.
- D.A.R.E. was established in schools, among other anti-drug programs.
	- "Take a bite out of crime"
- These campaigns seemed to be effective at first, with drug use rates going down among young people, peaking in the early 90s.
	- Eventually, the rates went back up but not to the original rates.
- **Frederick Case**
	- Student held up a sign saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" on the side of the street. 
	- His banner was confiscated, despite the fact that he didn't even step on school grounds.
	- Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school, saying that they did not violate his free speech.
		- They reasoned that even though he technically wasn't on school property, the event could be considered a "field trip" or a school sponsored event.
	- They couldn't consider the message to be political speech either, given the jokey nature of the banner.
	- Also claimed that the first amendment did not apply because:
		- Happened during school hours
		- Message was not political (as mentioned earlier)
	- Clarence Thomas also had interesting points:
		- Disagreed with Tinker, "students don't have rights"
		- Agreed with Justice Black (former KKK)
		- Believes that Frederick case wasn't enough
	- The dissent:
		- free speech is a right regardless of viewpoint
		- Frederick decision restricts the expression of a specific viewpoint
		- Drug policy/enforcement is political and a legitimate area of debate
		- People, including students, have a right to disagree with policy and oppose war on drugs
		- Proposals for legalization become more popular, even in the Alaska which is where the case originated.
