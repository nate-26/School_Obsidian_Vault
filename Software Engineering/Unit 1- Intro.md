**Software Engineering**
- The economies of all developed nations are dependent on software.
- More and more systems are software controlled.
- Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional software development.
- Expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of GNP in all developed countries.
- It is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through maintaining the system after it has gone into use.
- Engineering discipline
	- Using appropriate theories and methods to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints.
- All aspects
	- Not just development, also project management and development of tools, methods etc. to support software production.
---
**Software Costs**
- Software costs often dominate computer system costs. The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware cost.
- Software costs more to maintain than it does to develop. For systems with a long life, maintenance costs may be several times the development costs.
- Software engineering is concerned with cost-effective software development.
---
**Software Project Failure**
- Increasing system complexity
	- As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems, the demands change. Systems have to be built and delivered more quickly; larger, even more complex systems are required; systems have to have new capabilities that were previously thought to be impossible.
- Failure to use software engineering methods
	- It is fairly easy to write computer programs without using software engineering methods and techniques. Many companies have drifted into software development as their products and services have evolved. They do not use software engineering methods in their everyday work. Consequently, their software is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be.

**Software Products**
- Generic Products
	- Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
	- Examples: PC software such as graphic programs, project management tools; CAD software; software for specific markets such as appointment systems for dentists.
- Customized Products
	- Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.
	- Examples: embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems.
---
**Product Specification**
- Generic products
	- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the software developer and decisions on software changes are made by the developer.
- Customized products
	- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the customer for the software and they make decisions on software changes that are required.
---
**Essential Attributes of Good Software**
- Maintainability
	- Software should be written in a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of the customers. This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment.
- Dependability and Security
	- Should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Malicious users should not be able to access or damage the system.
- Efficiency
	- Should not make wasteful use of resources such as memory and processor cycles. 
- Acceptability
	- Must be acceptable to the user; must be understandable, usable and compatible with other systems.
---
**Software Process Activities**
- Software specification
	- Where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
- Software development
	- Software is designed and programmed
- Software validation
	- Software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires
- Software evolution
	- Where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.
---
**General Issues That Affect Software**
- Heterogeneity
	- Systems are increasingly required to have wide range of system compatibility across networks.
- Business and social change
- Security and Trust
- Scale
---
**Application Types**
- Stand-alone applications
	- Runs on a local computer, has all functionality and does not need to connect to a network.
- Interactive transaction-based applications
	- Applications that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals.
	- Web applications such as e-commerce applications.
- Embedded control systems
	- Software control systems that control and manage hardware. Numerically, there are more of these than any other type.
- Batch processing systems
	- Business systems designed to process data in large batches. Process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs.
- Entertainment systems
	- Systems primarily for personal use and intended to entertain the user.
- Systems for modeling and simulation
	- Systems developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situation, which include many, separate, interacting objects.
- Data collecting systems
	- Systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing
- Systems of systems
	- Systems composed of a number of other software systems

**Software Engineering Fundamentals**
- Systems should be developed using a managed and understood development process. Of course, different processes are used for different types of software. 
- Dependability and performance are important for all types of system.
- Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (what the software should do) are important.
- Where appropriate, you should reuse software that has already been developed.
---
**Internet Software Engineering**
- The web is now a platform for running applications and organizations are increasingly developing web-based systems rather than local systems.
- Web services allow application functionality to be accessed over the web.
- Cloud computing is an approach to the provision of computer services where applications run remotely on the 'cloud'
	- Users do not buy software but pay according to use.
---
**Web-Based Software Engineering**
- Web-based systems are complex distributed systems but the fundamental principles of software engineering discussed previously are as applicable to them as they are to any other type of system.
- The fundamental ideas of software engineering apply to web-based software in the same way that they apply to other types of software system.
- Software Reuse
	- Is the dominant approach for constructing web-based systems. When building these systems, you think about how you can assemble them from pre-existing software components and systems.
- Incremental and agile development
	- Web-based systems should be developed and delivered incrementally. It is now generally recognized that it is impractical to specify all the requirements for such systems in advance.
- Service-oriented systems
	- Software may be implemented using service-oriented software engineering, where the software components are stand-alone web services.
- Rich interfaces
	- Interface development technologies such as AJAX and HTML5 have emerged that support the creation of rich interfaces within a web browser.
---
**Software Engineering Ethics**
- Software engineering involves wider responsibilities than simply the application of technical skills.
- Software engineers must behave in an honest and ethically responsible way if they are to be respected as professionals.
- Ethical behavior is more than simply upholding the law but involves following a set of principles that are morally correct.
---
**Issues of Professional Responsibility**
- Confidentiality
	- Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed. 
- Competence
	- Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is outside their competence.
- Intellectual Property Rights
	- Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents, copyright, etc. They should not be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.
- Computer misuse
	- Software engineers should not use their technical skills to misuse other people's computers. Computer misuse ranges from relatively trivial (game playing on an employer's machine, say) to extremely serious (dissemination of viruses).

**ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics**
- The professional societies in the US have cooperated to produce a code of ethical practice.
- Members of these organizations sign up to the code of practice when they join.
- The code contains eight principles related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession.
- Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following principles:
	1. Public - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
	2. Client and employer - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
	3. Product - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
	4. Judgment - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
	5. Management - Software engineers managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
	6. Profession - Software engineers shall advance to the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
	7. Colleagues - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
	8. Self - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

**Rationale for the Code of Ethics**
- Computers have a central growing role in commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment and society at large. Software engineers are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software systems. 
- Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm, or to influence other to do good or cause harm. To ensure, as much as possible, that their efforts will be used for good, software engineers must commit themselves to making software engineering a beneficial and respected profession.
---
**Ethical Dilemmas**
- Disagreement in principle with the policies of senior management.
- Your employer acts in an unethical way and releases a safety-critical system without finishing the testing of the system.
- Participation in the development of military weapons systems or nuclear systems.
