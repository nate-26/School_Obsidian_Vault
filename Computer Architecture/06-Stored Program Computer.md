- A stored program computer stores the program so that you can change the program without changing the machine
	- Although computers have become faster and more reliable, the same principle components have been present since the beginning of the stored program computer.
- The opposite of a stored program computer is a device like a calculator where you have to input each step one at a time.
	- Mechanical calculators have existed since the 1600's.
	- Development limited by ability to machine the parts.
	- Handheld electronic calculators were invented in the 1970's, overlapping stored program technology.

## Jacquard Loom

- Possibly the first stored program computer.
- French Industrial Revolution (1800's)
- Related to punch cards ("IBM cards")
- Could weave Different complex patterns by using a different program (deck of cards).
- Still used today in less industrialized parts of the world.

## Historical Development | 4 Generations of Computers

- **Generation 0**: Mechanical Calculating Machines
	- Hollerith Cards (IBM cards) used as input through the 1970's
		- 80 columns = 80 character input line
		- Those punch cards are considered "first type of computer memory"
	- With the punch cards they performed calculations
	- Used EBCDIC

- **Generation 1**: Vacuum Tube Computers (1945 - 1953)
	- Atanasoff Berry Computers solved systems of linear equations
		- John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry of Iowa State University.
		- First totally electronic machine.
		- Destroyed during department cleanup.
	- Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)
		- John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, University of Pennsylvania 1946.
		- Lawsuits over whether Atanasoff or Mauchly and Eckert should get credit for inventing the computer.
		- First general-purpose computer
		- 17000 vacuum tubes
		- Two large rooms (one for AC)
		- 30 tons
		- Memory approx. 125 bytes
		- 1960's radio with vacuum tubes about the size of a toaster.
	- The IBM 650 was the first mass-produced computer (1955)
		- Magnetic drum, not a disk
		- Used decimal, not binary
		- Phased out in 1969

*IBM 650*

- **Generation 2**: Transistorized Computers (1954 - 1965)
	- Transistors more reliable than vacuum tubes
	- IBM 7094 (scientific) and 1401 (business)
	- Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1
		- ...and many others
	- Each of these computers had a different architecture.
	- Less than 1MB of memory
	- Chip had 2000 NAND gates

- **Generation 3**: Integrated Circuit Computers (1965 - 1980)
	- IBM 360/370
	- DEC PDP-8 and PDP-11
	- Cray-1 supercomputer
	- ...and many others
	- Beginning of the modern era
		- System software (operating systems and compilers)
		- Application software
	- Dominance of IBM
		- By using the same architecture, IBM provided an upgrade path.
		- Same architecture but not necessarily same hardware design
		- Scientific and business machines
			- Scientists need floating point
			- Business people don't want roundoff error
		- IBM was the Microsoft of its day, but it no longer is
![[Pasted image 20240930191651.png]]
- **Generation 4**: VLSI Computers (1980 - ???)
	- Very large scale integrated circuits (VSLI) have more than 10,000 components per chip/
	- Enable the creation of microprocessors.
	- 8080, 8086, and 8088 chips used in first personal computers in early 80's
	- Earliest PCs had no hard disk
		- 360KB per floppy disk (later 1.4MB)
		- Ran only one application at a time.

- Backwards compatibility
	- Backwards compatibility is the ability of a new machine to run software intended for the previous generation.
	- Essential to modern software industry because users want to spend their money on their core business, not on rewriting or converting software
- Importance of backwards compatibility
	- Current PC architecture became near-universal not because it was a good one but because it was created at the right time
	- Newer machines needed backward compatibility, so we are stuck with that architecture (and its successors) forever
	- IBM has also provided backwards compatibility for its mainframe line
- Moore’s Law (1965)
	- Gordon Moore (founder of Intel) in 1965: The density of transistors in an integrated circuit will double every year.
	- More recent version: Density of silicon chips doubles every 18 months.
- Just an approximation
	- Not a real law like that law of gravity.
	- That’s why different people have different versions.
- Can’t last forever
	- Eventually you’d have transistors smaller than an atom!
