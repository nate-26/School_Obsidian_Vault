- A stored program computer stores the program so that you can change the program without changing the machine
	- Although computers have become faster and more reliable, the same principle components have been present since the beginning of the stored program computer.
	- The opposite of a stored program computer is a device like a calculator where you have to input each step one at a time.
- First type of stored program computer is a Jacquard Loom, which used punch cards that controlled the different textiles.
	- IBM originally created computers using similar punch cards
---
- 4 generations of computers
- Generation 0: Mechanical Calculating Machines
	- Hollerith Cards (IBM cards) used as input
		- Those punch cards are considered "first type of computer memory"
	- With the punch cards they performed calculations
	- Used EBCDIC 
- Generation 1: Vacuum Tube Computers (1945 - 1953)
	- First totally electronic machine
	- Atanasoff Berry Computers solved systems of linear equations
	- Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)
		- First general-purpose computer
		- 17000 vacuum tubes
		- Two large rooms
		- 30 tons
	- The IBM 650 was the first mass-produced computer (1955)
		- Magnetic drum, not a disk
		- Used decimal, not binary
		- Phased out in 1969
- Generation 2: Transistorized Computers (1954 - 1965)
	- Transistors more reliable than vacuum tubes
	- IBM 7094 (scientific) and 1401 (business)
	- Chip had 2000 NAND gates
- Generation 3: Integrated Circuit Computers 
- Generation 4: VLSI Computers (1980 - ???)
