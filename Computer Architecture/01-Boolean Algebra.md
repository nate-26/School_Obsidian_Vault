- Computer Circuits are implementations of Boole's Laws of Thought
- Boolean algebra is a mathematical system for the manipulation of variables that can have only two values
	- In formal logic these values are "true" and "false".
	- In digital systems, these values are "on" and "off", 1 and 0, or "high" and "low".
- Boolean expressions are built by using Boolean operators to combine Boolean variables
	- Fundamental operators: AND, OR and NOT
- NOT is a unary operator
	- e.g.: NOT A
- AND and OR are binary operators
	- e.g.: A AND B & A OR B
- AND is "multiply" in Boolean algebra, can be written using any symbol for "times".
	- Called the Boolean product
	- Commonly written as concatenation, i.e., AB = A AND B
	- Can also be written as * or x, raised dot, or an upside down V
- OR is "add" in Boolean algebra, can be written using any symbol for "plus". 
	- Called the Boolean sum
	- Commonly written as +
	- Can also be written as V
- NOT is "negation", can be written with any symbol for negation
	- Can be written with a minus sign (-)
	- Can also be written with an overbar, or with the prime mark ('), the elbow, or the exclamation point.
	- Parenthesis can be used to avoid confusion
		- (A)(-B) = A(!B) = A AND NOT B
		- !AB = (!A)B = NOT A AND B
- **Order of operations**
	- Parenthesis has top
	- NOT next
	- AND next
	- OR has lowest
- AND binds tighter than OR
	- Way of saying that AND has priority over OR.
	- This is parallel to * having priority over +
- Better to use parenthesis with complex expressions
	- I.e., A AND B OR C = (A AND B) OR C
	- AB + C is another way to write the expression
